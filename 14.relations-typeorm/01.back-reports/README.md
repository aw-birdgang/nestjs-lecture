We have now spent a tremendous amount of time working on the authentication and user systems inside

of our application, we're pretty much all done with the user stuff for now.

So at this point, we're going to go back over to the reports functionality around our application.

As a quick reminder, this report stuff is going to allow a user to submit information about a vehicle

that they have sold and then eventually other users will be able to try to make a query and get an estimate

for the value of their car.

So whenever a user submits a report, they're going to give us the make model year mileage, longitude,

latitude and price that their car sold for.

We're going to record that and we're going to use that data whenever someone tries to get their estimate.

You might recall that we already generated some stuff around our reports feature, so we've already

got the reports module controller service and we didn't create the repository, we created the entity

which behind the scenes remember creates a repository for us.

So that means let's take a pause right here.

When we come back, the next video, we're going to start to work on this report's functionality.
